#  Bitwise Operators


'''& 	(AND)	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	{x & y}	
|	(OR)	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	{x | y}	
^	(XOR)	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	{x ^ y}	
~	(NOT)	Inverts all the bits	{~x}	
<<	(Zero fill left shift)	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	{x << 2}	
>>	(Signed right shift	Shift ) right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	{x >> 2}'''
